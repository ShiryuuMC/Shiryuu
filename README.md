# Shiryuu Server (支流)

[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/custom%2B15440%2Fgit%40github.com%3AShiryuuMC%2FShiryuu.git.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/custom%2B15440%2Fgit%40github.com%3AShiryuuMC%2FShiryuu.git?ref=badge_shield)

Shiryuu is a router proxy for Minecraft, allowing multiple servers to be hosted behind one IP with no client configuration.

Shiryuu can sit in front or behind of existing proxies like BungeeCord.

Please note that the client **must** connect to the server from the domain for routing to work. Shiryuu relies on the hostname sent by the client for routing. Of course, you can configure a fallback server.
